OARR: Open Access and Reproducible Research Compendium
=================================================

This wiki is a collection of philosophies and practices representing the state of the art in open access (OA) and reproducible research (RR). We hope to create a resource that is useful for those working in OA and RR, where they can collect a wide range of opinions, philosophies, examples, and implementations in the field without necessarily advocating one over the other. 

The project grew out of the TGAC AllBio [Open Science and Reproducibility Best Practices Workshop](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/allbio-open-science-reproducibility-best-practice-workshop/). With so many ideas and projects trying to tackle problems in OA and RR, many attendees of the workshop noted that it seemed like we were continually spawning ideas without solving enough problems. To more easily make use of all these ideas, it was decided to collect as many as possible in a single place, where beginners could go to get an idea of the field in its entirety, and experts could quickly reference to avoid treading over the same ground.

It should be noted that we are not the only resource covering these topics. Some others are:

* [ropensci](http://ropensci.github.io/reproducibility-guide/)
* [DIRT](http://dirtdirectory.org/)
* [ropengov](http://ropengov.github.io/)

While these are execellent resources for tools enabling OARR, this guide aims to also collect thoughts on the philosophy of OARR. For those looking to learn more about OARR, we recommend perusing *all* of these services.

See the [pages](list) for topics of interest.
