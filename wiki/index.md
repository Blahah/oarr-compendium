OARR: Open Access and Reproducible Research Compendium
=================================================

This wiki is a collection of philosophies and practices representing the state of the art in open access and reproducible research. We hope to create a resource that is useful for those working in OA and RR, where they can collect a wide range of opinions, philosophies, examples, and implemenations in the field without necessarily advocating one over the other. With so many different approaches to tackling the difficult problems inherent in pipelines, data hosting, open peer review, open access journals, open software, and the wide world of OARR.
