Representing Ideas
------------------

Along with the rise of new journals and thought for OA and RR, there has also been a flourishing of tools for integrating code, data, and writing. This includes "literate programming," integrating code and text with a markup language; collaboration tools for writing, such as ShareLatex; and open standards for both text markup languages like LaTex and metadata languages for keeping track of references.
