State of the Art in Reproducibility and Open Science
===========================================
A common complaint is that there have been too many approaches and not enough focus; what does this landscape look like *now*?  Are there projects or ideas already in existence that would be most valuable for thought leaders (ie, us) to put our efforts toward? How successful have these invidiual efforts been?

The deliverable would be either a wiki summarizing the results, a review paper, or both.

TODOs:
Need more on metadata, provenence
Some views from people who are anti-open access
Empirical research on OA/RR
Build/organize wiki
moar everything from people who know stuff who aren't me

Longer Term TODOs:
++summarization of overarching philosophies
