State of the Art in Reproducibility and Open Science
===========================================
A common complaint is that there have been too many approaches and not enough focus; what does this landscape look like *now*?  Are there projects or ideas already in existence that would be most valuable for thought leaders (ie, us) to put our efforts toward? How successful have these invidiual efforts been?

The deliverable would be either a wiki summarizing the results, a review paper, or both.
