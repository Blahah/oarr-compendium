Open Journals and Reviewing
---------------------------

By many measures, traditional publishers have been resistent to adopting policies and tools to enable OARR. This has spawned a new crop of journals pushing against this attitude; these include preprint servers, where papers can be posted before acceptance at a major outlet; open access journals which specifically shed access fees; and journals which encourage open code and data hosting. There has also been a push for open peer review systems, in response to frustration with perceived "old boys" clubs, scandals like the STAP stem cell publication, and in general, a new generation of scientists eager for alternative, less restrictive publishin schemes.
