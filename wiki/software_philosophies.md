# Software Philosophies

How do we design and distribute software in a way that maximally encourages OARR? This is, undoubtedly, a dauntingly broad area. It can cover software engineering philsophies, distribution tools, [ecosystems approaches](ecosystems), ideas on version control, and a whole slew of related thoughts and practices. This overlaps with several other sections, but also includes a subset of ideas which seem not to cleanly fit with any other area.

## Virtualization

* VMs are Bad for RR (C T Brown): [blog](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/vms-considered-harmful.html)
    * VMs don't allow remixing
* Greg Wilson, "VMs are PDF's for software": [tweet](https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/508402669825060864)
* Konrad Hinsen: more on VM's being bad: [blog](http://khinsen.wordpress.com/2013/08/14/platforms-for-reproducible-research/)
* Bill Howe: "...the point is that publishing a VM is trivial, while making your code portable and reusable for others is not. I think if everyone published a VM associated with their paper, which incurs essentially zero extra effort, we'd be in a better state than we are today. You're holding out for the utopia of everyone becoming linux hackers."
